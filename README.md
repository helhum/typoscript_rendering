TypoScript Rendering
====================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/helhum/typoscript_rendering.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/helhum/typoscript_rendering)

This extension provides a possibiltiy to render arbitrary TypoScript paths in
a given record context.

This is especially useful for rendering a plugin via an AjaxRequest

Composer installation
---------------------

As TYPO3 core aims to embrace composer more and more, it might be helpful to
know how to install the extension via composer. For this, not the GitHub
repository is used, but the official TER, so the same source you use for
installation via extension manager.

TYPO3 has an own Packagist service that distributes TER extensions for composer
installation.

For this to work, copy the repository block as shown in the
[information page](https://composer.typo3.org/satis.html#!/typoscript-rendering)
into your composer.json file and then run the command
_composer require typo3-ter/typoscript-rendering_ on command line.
